## How Permission Works

Permissions will be big topic. This part will be splited into two parts. One is about "How to config users permissions when using kapp?". Seconds is "How to build/integrate kapp, k8s with a IDP(Identity Provider)?"

The following topics are all related to permissions. Will reorganize later.
