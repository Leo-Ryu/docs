## Overview

Kalm SSO is based on the [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) standard, and is built on top of a set of widely used open source projects including [Istio](https://istio.io),
[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and [dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex).
Istio CRDs are used to configure Envoy, [ext_authz](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto) is used as a filter for protected endpoints.
Dex acts as a portal to other identity providers.

## Architecture

The picture shows the basic architecture of Kalm SSO.
During installation, kalm automatically sets up AuthProxy and Dex.

Any http traffic to your private component will first be checked by AuthProxy. If no valid authentication information is found, a redirect response(to authentication) is returned.
