## Standing on the shoulders of giants

Kalm SSO solution is based on [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) standard, and is built on top of widely used components, such as [Istio](https://istio.io),
[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and [dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex).
Kalm use Istio CRDs to configure Envoy, add [ext_authz](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto) filters for protected endpoints.
Dex acts as a portal to other identity providers.

## Architecture

The following picture shows the basic architecture of Kalm SSO.
Two extra components will be installed in your cluster, AuthProxy and Dex.
Any http traffic to your private component will be checked by auth proxy, if no valid authentication information is found, a redirect response will be returned to authenticate.
