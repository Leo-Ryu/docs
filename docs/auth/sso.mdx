title: Single Sign-on

## Overview

Kalm's Single Sign-on (SSO) system is based on the [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) standard and is built on top of a set of widely used open source projects including [Istio](https://istio.io),
[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), and [dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex).
Istio CRDs are used to configure Envoy, [ext_authz](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto) is used as a filter for protected endpoints.
Dex acts as a portal to other identity providers.

## Architecture

The picture below summarizes the basic architecture of Kalm's SSO system.
When you first install Kalm, both AuthProxy and Dex are setup automatically.

Any http traffic to your private components will first be checked by AuthProxy. If no valid authentication information is found, a redirect response(to authentication) is returned.
